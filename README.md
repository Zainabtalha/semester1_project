We have created airline reservation system to make the life of people easy by booking their tickets online. The airline reservation system project is an implementation of a general airline ticketing website which helps the customers to search the availability and prices of various airline tickets along with different packages available with the reservations. For people convenience there is a need for airline reservation system so that people do not have to wait in que to book their flight rather they can book it through server. It saves time and admin is the main authority which can do deletion, addition and modification of flights if required. This project also covers various features like online registration of users, modifying the details of the website by the management staff or administrator of the website, by adding, deleting or modifying the customer details, flights or packages information. In general, this system would be designed to perform like any other ticketing website available online.
